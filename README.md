# SQL

## Overview

Welcome to my personal learning repository on SQL (Structured Query Language). This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the code, queries, and concepts I have learned and implemented during my journey to master SQL. The primary objective of this repository is to keep a record of my learning progress and to have a reference point for future projects.

## Learning Journey

Throughout this learning experience, I have explored and implemented various fundamental and advanced concepts of SQL. The key topics covered include:

- **Basic Queries**: Understanding how to write basic SQL queries to retrieve data from databases using `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.
- **Joins**: Learning about different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) and their importance in combining data from multiple tables.
- **Aggregation Functions**: Using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` to perform calculations on data sets.
- **Grouping Data**: Implementing `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses to organize and filter aggregated data.
- **Subqueries**: Writing nested queries to perform complex data retrieval operations.
- **Data Manipulation**: Mastering `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` statements to manipulate data within tables.
- **Data Definition**: Learning about `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `RENAME` statements to define and modify database structures.
- **Constraints**: Implementing primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to maintain data integrity.
- **Views**: Creating and using views to simplify complex queries and enhance security.

Each section of this repository contains well-documented SQL scripts and exercises that I have worked on to reinforce my understanding of the respective topics. The goal is to create a robust and reusable codebase that demonstrates my grasp of SQL principles.

Feel free to explore the code, and I hope it serves as a useful reference for anyone looking to understand or revisit SQL concepts. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I am open to feedback!
